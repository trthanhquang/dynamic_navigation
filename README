1. First time setup:

echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

cd <repo>
catkin_make
echo "source $(pwd)/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

2. Compile Code:
cd <repo>
catkin_make 

3. To Start Simulator & Rviz
cd <repo>
roslaunch simulator_with_path_follower.launch

4. To run dijkstra algorithm
rosrun path_planner path_planner_node {goal_x} {goal_y} {goal_yaw}

5. To run D* lite algorithm
roscd path_planner
python dstar.py {init_x} {init_y} {init_yaw} {goal_x} {goal_y} {goal_yaw}

6. Footprint of the robot in meters

footprint: [ [0.3302, -0.0508], [0.254, -0.0508], [0.254, -0.254], [-0.254, -0.254], [-0.254, 0.254], [0.254, 0.254], [0.254, 0.0508], [0.3302, 0.0508] ]

Which can be simplified to: footprint = [ [0.3302, -0.254], [0.3302,  0.254], [-0.254, -0.254], [-0.254,  0.254] ]


7. Use valgrind to debug segfault
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug --pkg path_planner
roslaunch valgrind_path_planner.launch

8. Install ipython notebook/jupyter to view ipynb file which contains  rrt and D*lite algorithm in src/path_planner
