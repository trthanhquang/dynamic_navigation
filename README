1. First time setup:

echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

cd <repo>
catkin_make
echo "source $(pwd)/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

2. Compile Code:
cd <repo>
catkin_make 

3. To Start Simulator & Rviz
cd <repo>
roslaunch robot_and_map.launch

4. Sample code which generates a path and publish is located at <repo>/src/path_planner/path_generator.py
To run sample path generator: $ rosrun path_planner path_generator.py

5. Footprint of the robot in meters

footprint: [ [0.3302, -0.0508], [0.254, -0.0508], [0.254, -0.254], [-0.254, -0.254], [-0.254, 0.254], [0.254, 0.254], [0.254, 0.0508], [0.3302, 0.0508] ]

Which can be simplified to: footprint = [ [0.3302, -0.254], [0.3302,  0.254], [-0.254, -0.254], [-0.254,  0.254] ]

6. Important topics:
/current_pose (datatype: PoseStamped) this is the GPS location of the robot
/map (datatype: OccupancyGrid) this is the static map

7. Initial Pose of the Robot: x=2, y=2, yaw=45degree
